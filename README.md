# Introductions
We are required to develop a small system using __MAVEN__ and __Java__ programming language. The system should be able to:
1. Read data from a Github Issue page. Refer to the link below for the testing purpose.

3. Compare the data and produce the following reports:
   * List all students who have submitted the GitHub account.
   * List all students who have not submitted the GitHub account.
